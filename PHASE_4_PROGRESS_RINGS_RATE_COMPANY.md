# Phase 4: Progress Rings in Rate a Company Results
**Date:** 2025-10-30  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Summary

Added progress rings to Rate a Company results where they add meaningful value for comparing performance. Progress rings make sense here because users are comparing a company's performance against their ICP criteria.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Overall Score - Progress Ring (80px)
**Location:** Rate a Company results → Header section  
**Before:** Large text display `{rating.overallScore}/100` (text-3xl)  
**After:** Progress ring (80px) showing overall score (0-100)  
**Rationale:** Visual progress indicator for overall match quality - makes it easy to see at a glance how well the company fits

**Features:**
- 80px ring with 6px stroke width
- Auto color coding (green ≥90%, teal ≥80%, amber ≥70%, red <70%)
- Center percentage label
- Tier name displayed below ring
- Progress bar still visible for additional context

---

### 2. Individual Criteria Scores - Progress Rings (56px)
**Location:** Rate a Company results → Criteria Breakdown section  
**Before:** Text display `{criteria.score}/10`  
**After:** Progress ring (56px) showing criteria score converted to percentage (score * 10)  
**Rationale:** Visual comparison across criteria - makes it easy to scan which criteria the company scores well on vs. poorly

**Features:**
- 56px ring with 5px stroke width
- Auto color coding based on score
- Center percentage label (shows score * 10, e.g., 8/10 = 80%)
- Weighted score displayed below ring
- Easy visual comparison across criteria

---

## Files Modified

1. `src/features/icp-analysis/widgets/RateCompanyWidget.tsx`
   - Added ProgressRing import
   - Replaced overall score text with progress ring
   - Replaced criteria score text with progress rings

---

## Visual Changes

### Overall Score Display:
- **Before:** Large text "85/100" with tier name
- **After:** Progress ring (80px) with center "85%" label, tier name below

### Criteria Score Display:
- **Before:** Text "8/10" with weighted score
- **After:** Progress ring (56px) with center percentage, weighted score below

---

## Rationale

**Why Progress Rings Make Sense Here:**
1. **Comparing Performance:** Users are comparing a company's performance against their ICP
2. **Visual Scanning:** Rings make it easy to quickly see which criteria score well vs. poorly
3. **Relative Comparison:** Visual progress helps users understand relative performance across criteria
4. **Performance Metrics:** These are actual performance scores, not static percentages or weights

**Difference from ICP Overview:**
- ICP Overview: Static percentages/weights (25%, 30%) don't need visual progress
- Rate a Company: Performance scores (85/100, 8/10) benefit from visual representation
