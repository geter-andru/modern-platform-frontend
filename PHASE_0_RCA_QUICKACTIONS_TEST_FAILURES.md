# Root Cause Analysis (RCA): QuickActions Test Failures
**Date:** 2025-10-30  
**Component:** `src/features/dashboard/__tests__/QuickActions.test.tsx`  
**Status:** Pre-Existing Test Failures  
**Impact:** 10 of 17 tests failing

---

## Problem Statement

The QuickActions component tests are failing because:
1. **Test Expectations**: Tests expect competency-based unlock logic, progress calculations, and tool availability logic
2. **Actual Implementation**: Component is a simple static presentation component with no business logic
3. **Test/Code Mismatch**: Tests written for functionality that doesn't exist in current implementation

---

## RCA Protocol Analysis

### 1. Symptom Identification

**Failing Tests:**
- `renders without crashing` - Multiple elements found (expects single)
- `Cost Calculator unlocks at 70+ value communication score` - No unlock logic exists
- `Business Case unlocks at 70+ sales execution score` - No unlock logic exists
- `handles undefined competency scores` - No score handling exists
- `handles partial competency scores` - No score handling exists
- `calculates progress correctly for partial completion` - No progress calculation exists
- `handles zero score progress` - No progress calculation exists
- `handles 100% completion` - No progress calculation exists
- `handles negative competency scores` - No score validation exists
- `handles extremely high competency scores` - No score validation exists

**Passing Tests:**
- `renders default actions when no actions provided`
- `renders custom actions when provided`
- `applies custom className`
- `ICP tool is always unlocked`
- `calls onActionClick when action is clicked`
- `does not crash when onActionClick is undefined`
- `handles empty actions array`

### 2. Root Cause Identification

**Root Cause:**
- **Test Suite Mismatch**: Tests were written for a different component implementation
- **Missing Features**: Tests expect features that don't exist:
  - Competency score-based unlock logic
  - Progress calculation towards unlocks
  - Tool availability based on scores
  - Score validation and handling

**Evidence:**
1. Current `QuickActions.tsx` implementation:
   - Static actions array
   - No `competencyScores` prop handling
   - No unlock logic
   - No progress calculation
   - Simple presentation component only

2. Test expectations:
   - Tests pass `competencyScores` prop
   - Tests expect unlock logic based on scores
   - Tests expect progress calculations
   - Tests expect score validation

3. Component Props:
   - **Actual**: `QuickActionsProps { customerId: string }`
   - **Expected by Tests**: `QuickActionsProps { competencyScores?: { valueCommunication?: number; salesExecution?: number }; actions?: Action[]; onActionClick?: (id: string) => void; }`

### 3. Impact Assessment

**Functional Impact:**
- ✅ **NO FUNCTIONAL IMPACT** - Component works correctly for its intended purpose
- ✅ Component renders correctly
- ✅ Actions are clickable
- ✅ Component accepts className prop

**Test Impact:**
- ❌ 10 tests failing (59% failure rate)
- ⚠️ Test coverage appears low but tests test wrong functionality
- ⚠️ CI/CD may fail if tests block deployments

**User Impact:**
- ✅ **NO USER IMPACT** - Component functions correctly
- ✅ Users can access quick actions
- ✅ Navigation works correctly

### 4. Contributing Factors

**Historical Context:**
- Component may have had unlock logic that was removed
- Tests may have been written for a planned feature that wasn't implemented
- Component may have been refactored but tests weren't updated
- Tests may be testing against a different component (wrong file path)

**Code Evolution:**
- Current implementation is a simple presentation component
- No business logic in component
- Logic may have been moved elsewhere or removed

### 5. Resolution Options

#### Option A: Fix Tests to Match Implementation (RECOMMENDED for Design Phase)
**Action:** Update tests to match actual component behavior  
**Scope:** Test changes only  
**Impact:** Tests will pass  
**Risk:** Low - No functional changes  
**Timeline:** 30 minutes

**Changes Required:**
- Remove competency score tests
- Remove unlock logic tests
- Remove progress calculation tests
- Update tests to match actual component props and behavior
- Keep basic rendering and click tests

#### Option B: Implement Missing Features (NOT RECOMMENDED for Design Phase)
**Action:** Add competency score logic to component  
**Scope:** Functional changes  
**Impact:** Component behavior changes  
**Risk:** HIGH - This would be a functional change, not styling  
**Timeline:** 4-8 hours

**Changes Required:**
- Add competency score props
- Implement unlock logic
- Implement progress calculation
- Add score validation
- This violates "styling-only" requirement

#### Option C: Document and Skip (FOR NOW)
**Action:** Document mismatch, proceed with design changes  
**Scope:** Documentation  
**Impact:** Tests continue to fail  
**Risk:** Medium - May block CI/CD  
**Timeline:** 15 minutes

**Changes Required:**
- Document the mismatch
- Note that tests are for different functionality
- Proceed with design changes (styling-only)
- Fix tests later in separate phase

## Recommended Resolution

**For Design Execution Phase: Option C → Option A**

1. **Immediate (Phase 0)**: Document mismatch (this RCA)
2. **Phase 0.5 (Before Design Changes)**: Fix tests to match implementation (Option A)
3. **Rationale**: 
   - Aligns tests with actual component
   - No functional changes (only test changes)
   - Allows design changes to proceed safely
   - Prevents false test failures

---

## Test Fix Plan (Option A)

### Step 1: Update Component Props in Tests
```typescript
// Remove competencyScores from test props
// Component only accepts: { customerId: string }
```

### Step 2: Remove Unlock Logic Tests
```typescript
// Remove tests for:
// - Cost Calculator unlocks at 70+
// - Business Case unlocks at 70+
// - Tool availability based on scores
```

### Step 3: Remove Progress Calculation Tests
```typescript
// Remove tests for:
// - Progress calculation
// - Score-based progress
// - Progress percentages
```

### Step 4: Remove Score Validation Tests
```typescript
// Remove tests for:
// - Undefined scores handling
// - Partial scores handling
// - Negative scores handling
// - High scores handling
```

### Step 5: Keep Valid Tests
```typescript
// Keep tests for:
// - Basic rendering
// - Action rendering
// - className prop
// - Action clicks
// - Empty actions array
```

### Step 6: Fix "renders without crashing" Test
```typescript
// Change from:
expect(screen.getByText(/Rate New Prospect|Update Cost Model/i))

// To:
expect(screen.getAllByText(/Rate New Prospect|Update Cost Model/i)).toHaveLength(2)
// OR be more specific with queries
```

## Decision

**Recommendation:** Fix tests now (Option A) before proceeding with design changes

**Reasoning:**
1. Tests should accurately reflect component behavior
2. Prevents confusion during design phase
3. Test fixes are not functional changes (allowed)
4. Cleaner baseline for design work
5. Prevents false failures during design phase

**Timeline:** 30 minutes for test fixes  
**Risk:** Low - Only test changes, no functional changes  
**Impact:** Tests will pass, clearer baseline

---

## Next Steps

1. Fix tests to match actual component (Option A)
2. Verify all tests pass
3. Update baseline
4. Proceed with design execution plan

**OR**

1. Document mismatch (this RCA)
2. Proceed with design changes (styling-only)
3. Fix tests in separate phase

**Which approach should we take?**
