# Microcopy Voice Guide V2
**The Middle Ground: Professional + Philosophical**
**Date:** November 3, 2025
**Status:** Approved Direction
**Purpose:** Write platform copy that hints at Humus & Shore philosophy without being academic

---

## The Core Principle

**Use philosophical CONCEPTS in normal business language.**

Don't:
- ❌ Use academic language ("intrinsic capabilities", "systematize", "engineer")
- ❌ Use metaphors in platform UI ("desert", "soil", "shore")
- ❌ Explain the philosophy in every interaction

Do:
- ✅ Use clear positioning language that hints at philosophy
- ✅ Keep metaphors for educational pages only (About, Why Andru)
- ✅ Let the concepts speak through simple, professional language

---

## The Gold Standard: Current Homepage

**What works:**
```
"Revenue Intelligence Infrastructure"
→ Clear category, professional

"Build Revenue Where You're Essential, Not Optional"
→ Philosophical concept in plain English

"Discover markets where you're essential & convert buyers
into customer evangelists through systematic intelligence"
→ Clear benefit, hints at transformation
```

**Why it works:**
- Professional business language
- "Essential vs Optional" concept is clear and memorable
- No academic jargon
- No metaphors that need explanation

---

## Voice Guidelines

### ✅ Good Voice (The Middle Ground)

**Characteristics:**
- Clear and professional
- Uses positioning concepts: "essential vs optional", "signal vs noise"
- Normal business vocabulary
- Confident, not academic
- Actionable, not theoretical

**Examples:**
- "Where You're Essential" (not "Your Desert")
- "Build on Signal, Not Noise" (not "Engineer Pure Signal from Intrinsic Capabilities")
- "Find buyers who need you desperately" (not "Identify maximum value realization prospects")

### ❌ Too Generic (What We Had Before)

**Examples:**
- "Get Started"
- "Create ICP"
- "Join Free Beta"
- "See Demo"

**Why bad:** No differentiation. Could be any SaaS product.

### ❌ Too Philosophical (What I Proposed)

**Examples:**
- "Engineer pure signal from intrinsic capabilities, not customer accidents"
- "Export Your Desert Map"
- "Let contaminated assumptions die so richer understanding can grow"
- "Measure mathematical fit between capabilities and buyer needs"

**Why bad:** Too academic. Users don't talk this way. Feels like reading a whitepaper.

---

## Practical Examples: The Middle Ground

### Homepage CTAs

**Current (Generic):**
```
"Join Free Beta"
"Go to Dashboard"
"See Live Demo"
```

**Too Philosophical:**
```
"Start with Signal, Not Noise"
"Enter Your Revenue Infrastructure"
"See Pure Signal in Action"
```

**The Middle Ground:**
```
"Start Building Where You're Essential"
"Go to Dashboard"
"See How It Works"
```

**Why:** "Building Where You're Essential" uses the philosophical concept but in natural language. "See How It Works" is clearer than "See Pure Signal in Action" (which requires understanding Pure Signal first).

---

### ICP Tool Widget Descriptions

**Current (Generic):**
```
Product Details
"Core ICP analysis workflow"

Rating System
"Rate and evaluate ICP framework"

Personas
"Generate buyer personas"
```

**Too Philosophical:**
```
Product Capabilities
"Engineer pure signal from intrinsic capabilities, not customer accidents"

Value Alignment Framework
"Measure mathematical fit between capabilities and buyer needs"

Maximum Value Buyers
"Identify buyers who achieve maximum (not minimum) value realization"
```

**The Middle Ground:**
```
Product Details
"Build your ICP from what you do best"

Rating System
"Measure how well prospects match your strengths"

Buyer Personas
"Identify buyers who need you most"
```

**Why:** Still hints at the philosophy (what you do best = capabilities, need you most = essential vs optional) but in everyday business language.

---

### Export Modal

**Current (Generic):**
```
Title: "Export ICP Analysis"
Headline: "Choose Export Format"
Description: "Export X buyer personas as ready-to-use sales materials"
```

**Too Philosophical:**
```
Title: "Share Your Pure Signal"
Headline: "Export Your Desert Map"
Description: "Share the markets where you're essential with X engineered buyer profiles"
```

**The Middle Ground:**
```
Title: "Export Your ICP"
Headline: "Share Where You're Essential"
Description: "Export X buyer personas showing markets where you have the strongest fit"
```

**Why:** "Where You're Essential" uses our core concept. "Strongest fit" is professional language for the same idea. No desert metaphor needed.

---

### Error Messages

**Current (Generic):**
```
"No personas available to export. Please generate your ICP first."
"Failed to export PDF. Please try again."
```

**Too Philosophical:**
```
"No pure signal generated yet. Engineer your ICP from product capabilities first."
"Signal report generation failed. Retry to complete transformation."
```

**The Middle Ground:**
```
"No ICP generated yet. Start by describing what makes your product essential."
"Export failed. Please try again."
```

**Why:** First error teaches the concept (what makes you essential) without jargon. Second error is just clear and direct - no need to philosophize.

---

### Loading States

**Current (Generic):**
```
"Loading..."
"Generating PDF..."
"Processing..."
```

**Too Philosophical:**
```
"Engineering your pure signal..."
"Building signal report (PDF)..."
"Transforming noise into systematic intelligence..."
```

**The Middle Ground:**
```
"Building your ICP..."
"Creating your report..."
"Analyzing..."
```

**Why:** Simple, clear, professional. Loading states don't need philosophy lessons.

---

### Success Messages

**Current (Generic):**
```
"PDF exported successfully!"
"Markdown copied to clipboard! Paste into Notion."
```

**Too Philosophical:**
```
"Signal report ready! Your desert map has been exported."
"Pure signal copied to clipboard. Paste into Notion to preserve systematic intelligence."
```

**The Middle Ground:**
```
"ICP report exported successfully!"
"Copied to clipboard. Paste into Notion to save your analysis."
```

**Why:** Clear confirmation + helpful next step. No metaphors or jargon needed.

---

## Where to Use Different Voice Levels

### Platform UI (80% of copy) → Middle Ground Voice
- Button labels
- Form fields
- Error messages
- Success confirmations
- Navigation
- Widget descriptions
- Dashboard copy

**Tone:** Professional, clear, hints at philosophy through positioning language

### Educational Content (20% of copy) → Can Be More Philosophical
- About page
- Why Andru page
- Onboarding tutorials
- Help documentation
- Blog posts

**Tone:** Can explain philosophy, use metaphors, tell the story

**This is where desert/humus/shore metaphors belong.**

---

## The Positioning Concepts We Use

These concepts hint at the philosophy without explaining it:

1. **"Essential vs Optional"** - Core positioning
   - Use freely in platform UI
   - Users understand immediately
   - Example: "Build where you're essential, not optional"

2. **"Signal vs Noise"** - Can use sparingly
   - Good for headlines: "Build on Signal, Not Noise"
   - Don't overuse in UI
   - Better for educational content

3. **"Strongest Fit" / "Best Match"** - Professional alternative
   - Use when "essential" feels too strong
   - Example: "Find your strongest fit markets"

4. **"What Makes You Essential"** - Bridge concept
   - Connects product capabilities to positioning
   - Natural business language
   - Example: "Describe what makes your product essential"

## Microcopy Patterns (Updated)

### Pattern 1: CTA Buttons

**Format:** `[Action Verb] + [Benefit with Concept]`

✅ Good:
- "Build Where You're Essential"
- "Find Your Best Fit Markets"
- "Discover Who Needs You Most"

❌ Too generic:
- "Get Started"
- "Try Now"

❌ Too philosophical:
- "Engineer Pure Signal"
- "Discover Your Desert"

---

### Pattern 2: Form Labels/Placeholders

**Format:** `[Clear label] + [Helpful guidance]`

✅ Good:
```
Label: "Product Strengths"
Placeholder: "What does your product do better than alternatives?"
```

❌ Too generic:
```
Label: "Product Description"
Placeholder: "Describe your product"
```

❌ Too philosophical:
```
Label: "Intrinsic Capabilities"
Placeholder: "What you built, not who bought it"
```

---

### Pattern 3: Empty States

**Format:** `[What's missing] + [Clear next step with concept]`

✅ Good:
```
"No ICP yet. Start by describing what makes your product essential to specific buyers."
```

❌ Too generic:
```
"No data yet. Get started by creating your first ICP."
```

❌ Too philosophical:
```
"Your desert awaits discovery. Start by cataloging your product's intrinsic capabilities—not who bought, but what you built."
```

---

### Pattern 4: Error Recovery

**Format:** `[What happened] + [How to fix it]`

✅ Good:
```
"ICP generation failed. Check your product description is complete and try again."
```

❌ Too generic:
```
"Error 500. Please try again."
```

❌ Too philosophical:
```
"Transformation blocked by contaminated data. Pure Signal requires first-principles input."
```

   - Set expectations for the tool
   - Use "essential vs optional" framing

3. **Primary Action Buttons** (10-15 across platform)
   - "Generate ICP" → "Build Your ICP"
   - "Create Report" → "Create Your Report"
   - Keep it simple and clear

### Phase 2: Widget & Feature Descriptions (Week 2)
Make features clearer:

1. **ICP Widget Descriptions** (5 widgets)

## Quality Checklist

For every piece of microcopy, ask:

### 1. Is it clear?
- ✅ Would a new user understand immediately?
- ✅ No jargon or terms that need explanation?
- ✅ Action or benefit obvious?

### 2. Is it professional?
- ✅ Sounds like business communication?
- ✅ Not too academic or theoretical?
- ✅ Confident but not arrogant?

### 3. Does it hint at philosophy?
- ✅ Uses positioning concepts ("essential", "strongest fit")?
- ✅ But doesn't require understanding philosophy first?
- ✅ Natural, not forced?

### 4. Is it consistent?
- ✅ Matches voice of homepage?
- ✅ Uses approved vocabulary?
- ✅ No desert/humus/shore metaphors in UI?

**If you answer "no" to any question in sections 1-2, rewrite.**
**If you answer "no" to question in section 3, it's too generic.**
**If philosophy feels heavy or forced, simplify.**

## Examples: Before → Too Philosophical → Middle Ground

### Example 1: ICP Generation Button

**Before (Generic):**
"Generate ICP"

**Too Philosophical:**
"Engineer Pure Signal from Capabilities"

**Middle Ground:**
"Build Your ICP"

**Why middle ground works:** Clear action verb, professional, implies you're building something valuable.

---

### Example 2: Widget Description

**Before (Generic):**
"Generate buyer personas"

**Too Philosophical:**
"Identify buyers who achieve maximum (not minimum) value realization"

**Middle Ground:**
"Identify buyers who need you most"

**Why middle ground works:** "Need you most" captures the essential concept without jargon. Simple, clear, memorable.

---

### Example 3: Empty State

**Before (Generic):**
"No ICP yet. Get started by entering your product details."

**Too Philosophical:**
"Your desert awaits discovery. Start by cataloging your product's intrinsic capabilities—not who bought, but what you built."

**Middle Ground:**
"No ICP yet. Start by describing what makes your product essential to specific buyers."

**Why middle ground works:** Guides user clearly. "What makes you essential" teaches the concept naturally without metaphors.

---

### Example 4: Error Message

**Before (Generic):**
"Error: Unable to generate ICP. Please try again."

**Too Philosophical:**
"Transformation blocked by contaminated data. Pure Signal requires clean, first-principles input about your product capabilities."

**Middle Ground:**
"Unable to generate ICP. Make sure you've described your product's main strengths and try again."

**Why middle ground works:** Tells user what went wrong and how to fix it. Clear and helpful, no philosophy lesson needed.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Academic Voice
❌ "Leverage AI to systematize intrinsic capability analysis"
✅ "Use AI to identify your best fit markets"

### 2. Metaphor Overload (In UI)
❌ "Plant seeds in fertile desert soil to grow evangelists"
✅ "Turn buyers into advocates"

### 3. Explaining Philosophy in Microcopy
❌ "Humus & Shore's Pure Signal methodology helps you..."
✅ "Find markets where you're essential"

### 4. Consultant Speak
❌ "Optimize value realization through systematic buyer alignment"
✅ "Connect with buyers who need you most"

### 5. Buzzword Bingo
❌ "Transform, disrupt, revolutionize, leverage, unlock"
✅ "Build, find, identify, create, discover"

## Usage Notes

**For Platform UI:**
Use this guide. Aim for the middle ground examples.

**For Educational Content (About, Why Andru):**
You can be more philosophical. This is where you explain Humus & Shore, use desert metaphors, tell the story. But even here, be clear first, philosophical second.

**When In Doubt:**
Ask: "Would the homepage headline work if I used this voice?" If no, simplify.
