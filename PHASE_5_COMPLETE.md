---

## Changes Made

### 1. RateCompanyWidget.tsx
**Placeholder:**
- **Before:** "Enter company name (e.g., TechCorp Solutions)"
- **After:** "e.g., Stripe, GitHub, Vercel, Datadog"
- **Rationale:** Technical, specific examples instead of generic placeholder

**Pro Tip → Next Steps:**
- **Before:** Generic "Use this rating to prioritize your sales efforts..."
- **After:** "Prioritize Tier 1 (20-24 points) and Tier 2 (16-19 points) companies for immediate outreach. Reference specific criteria scores below 7/10 to craft targeted messaging addressing those gaps. Export this rating to share with your sales team or add to your CRM."
- **Rationale:** Specific, actionable guidance with concrete thresholds and next steps

---

### 2. MyICPOverviewWidget.tsx
**When to Use Scenarios:**
- **Sales Calls:** Added specific guidance about referencing firmographics, surfacing technical challenges within first 2 minutes, using actual key indicators
- **Marketing Campaigns:** Added technical value proposition guidance with specific pain point examples (API integration, data silos, scalability bottlenecks)
- **Product Development:** Added specific guidance about prioritizing top 3 pain points and validating against segment criteria

**Pro Tip → Action:**
- **Before:** Generic "Use this comprehensive analysis to guide..."
- **After:** "Export this ICP before prospect calls to reference firmographics, pain points, and technical requirements. Use the rating criteria weights to prioritize qualification questions (focus on criteria with 25%+ weight first)."
- **Rationale:** Specific, actionable guidance with concrete thresholds

**Rating Criteria Description:**
- **Before:** "Use these weighted criteria to score potential customers:"
- **After:** "Use these weighted criteria to score potential customers against your ICP. Higher weights indicate more critical qualification factors. Multiply each criteria score by its weight percentage to calculate weighted contribution to overall match score."
- **Rationale:** Explains how to use the weights with technical precision

**Empty State:**
- **Before:** "Generate an ICP analysis to see your customer profile here."
- **After:** "Generate an ICP analysis from Product Details to see your customer profile, segments, and rating criteria here."
- **Rationale:** More specific about what to expect and where to generate

### 3. ProductDetailsWidget.tsx
**Product Name Placeholder:**
- **Before:** "Enter your product name"
- **After:** "e.g., Revenue Intelligence Platform, API Gateway, Data Pipeline"
- **Rationale:** Technical, specific examples

**Product Description Placeholder:**
- **Before:** "Describe what your product does and its main value proposition"
- **After:** "Describe core functionality, technical architecture, and primary use cases. Include key technical capabilities (e.g., real-time data processing, REST API integration, multi-tenant architecture)."
- **Rationale:** Specific, technical guidance with concrete examples
