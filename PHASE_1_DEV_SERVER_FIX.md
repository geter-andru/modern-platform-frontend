# Phase 1: Dev Server Fix
**Date:** 2025-10-30  
**Issue:** 404 errors for Next.js static assets after Phase 1 changes

---

## Problem

After Phase 1 navigation changes, the development server showed 404 errors:
- `layout.css` - Failed to load (404)
- `main-app.js` - Failed to load (404)
- `app-pages-internals.js` - Failed to load (404)
- Preload resource warnings

## Root Cause

The Next.js `.next` cache was stale after:
1. Running `npm run build` during Phase 1 validation
2. Switching branches
3. Making navigation component changes

## Solution

**Restart the dev server with clean cache:**

```bash
cd frontend
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

**Steps to fix:**
1. Stop the current dev server (if running)
2. Clear the `.next` cache directory
3. Restart the dev server: `npm run dev`

This will force Next.js to rebuild the development cache with the latest Phase 1 changes.

## Verification

After restarting, check:
- ✅ No 404 errors in console
- ✅ Navigation displays correctly with sections
- ✅ Active states work (thin underline in Electric Teal)
- ✅ All routes accessible

---

## Note

This is **NOT related to Phase 1 code changes**. This is a standard Next.js dev server cache issue that occurs when:
- Build artifacts mix with dev server cache
- Switching branches
- Making structural changes to components

**Phase 1 changes are correct and tested. This is just a cache refresh.**
