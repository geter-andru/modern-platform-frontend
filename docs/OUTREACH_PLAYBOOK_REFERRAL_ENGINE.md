# OPTION 2: REFERRAL ENGINE PLAYBOOK
## Turn Custom ICP Pages into "Founder Gifts" for Warm Introductions

**Status:** Primary strategy - execute first
**Timeline:** Week 1-2
**Expected Results:** 40-60% of connectors will forward, 20-30% response rate from founders

---

## The Strategy

Instead of cold outreaching to the 94 companies directly, use the custom ICP pages as **gifts to unlock warm introductions** from your network. This leverages social proof and removes sales pressure.

---

## Step 1: Identify Your Connectors (Day 1)

### Who Qualifies as a Connector?

**Tier 1 (Highest Priority):**
- YC partners/alumni who know these founders
- Angel investors in your network
- Mutual founder friends
- Technical advisors/mentors who work with these companies

**Tier 2 (Good Reach):**
- LinkedIn connections with 2nd-degree connections to target founders
- People who've worked at these companies
- Conference/community connections
- Customer/users of these products

**Tier 3 (Long Shot):**
- Twitter mutuals who follow these companies
- Newsletter subscribers who work in the industry
- Community members in shared Slack/Discord channels

### How to Find Them

**LinkedIn Method:**
1. Go to target founder's profile (e.g., Greptile's founder)
2. Click "X mutual connections"
3. Export list of mutuals
4. Prioritize by relationship strength

**Twitter Method:**
1. Search: `from:yourusername (greptile OR @greptile)`
2. Find tweets where you mentioned/tagged them
3. Look at replies - who engaged?
4. Those are warm connections

**Email List Method:**
1. Search your inbox: `greptile.com OR greptile.ai`
2. Find conversations with anyone at the company
3. Use those as warm intro paths

### Create Your Connector Spreadsheet

```
| Company    | Target Founder  | Connector Name | Relationship Strength (1-5) | Introduction Method | Notes                  |
|------------|----------------|----------------|----------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Greptile   | Daksh Gupta    | John Smith     | 4                          | Email               | Worked together at YC  |
| PostHog    | James Hawkins  | Sarah Lee      | 3                          | LinkedIn            | Met at SaaStr 2024     |
| Vanta      | Christina Cacioppo | Mike Chen   | 5                          | Text                | Close friend           |
```

**Goal:** Map at least 20-30 companies where you have Tier 1-2 connectors.

---

## Step 2: Craft the "Connector Request" Message (Day 2)

### The Psychology

**What you're NOT doing:**
- Asking them to pitch your product
- Making them vouch for something they haven't tried
- Creating awkward social pressure

**What you ARE doing:**
- Sharing valuable content their friend will appreciate
- Making them look like a thoughtful connector
- Giving them a low-effort way to add value

### Template A: For Close Connectors (Tier 1)

**Subject:** Gift for [Founder Name] - thought you'd want to share

```
Hey [Connector Name],

Quick favor that I think you'll actually enjoy doing.

I built something for [Company] that I think [Founder Name] would find genuinely valuable.

It's a customer journey map showing how [Company] delivers value - from the moment their customer realizes they need [product category] to the specific timestamps where [Company] creates impact.

Full narrative timeline with:
- The worst-case scenario their customers are avoiding
- What customers are thinking/feeling at each stage
- The exact moments where [Company] creates value

No pitch, no ask. Just thought leadership that might be useful for their product/sales team.

Here's the link: [your domain]/icp/[company-slug]

If you think it's share-worthy, would you mind forwarding it to [Founder Name]? I'd genuinely love their feedback on whether we nailed it or missed the mark.

If you think it's not worth sharing, totally cool - no pressure.

Best,
Brandon

P.S. - This is the kind of buyer intelligence Andru generates. If you know other founders who need ICP clarity, I've got 93 more of these.
```

**Why This Works:**
- **Value-first:** You're giving their friend something useful, not asking for a favor
- **Low pressure:** "If you think it's not worth sharing, totally cool"
- **Social proof:** Shows you've done this for 93 other companies
- **Escape hatch:** They can review it first before forwarding

### Template B: For Medium Connectors (Tier 2)

**Subject:** Would [Founder Name] find this useful?

```
Hey [Connector Name],

I built something for [Company] that I'm hoping to get feedback on from [Founder Name].

It's a customer journey map - showing the emotional timeline of how their customers experience value, from pain point to "wow" moment.

Link: [your domain]/icp/[company-slug]

Two questions:
1. Do you think [Founder Name] would find this interesting?
2. If yes, would you be comfortable forwarding it?

No pressure if not - I'm trying to figure out if this type of content is actually valuable to founders or if it's just consultant theater.

Appreciate your gut check either way.

-Brandon
```

**Why This Works:**
- **Asks permission first:** "Would you be comfortable..."
- **Validates their judgment:** "Do you think..."
- **Low-stakes:** Just asking for feedback, not a warm intro
- **Humble framing:** "trying to figure out if this is valuable"

### Template C: For Weak Connectors (Tier 3)

**Subject:** Quick question about [Company]

```
Hey [Connector Name],

Saw you're connected to [Founder Name] at [Company] on LinkedIn.

I built a customer journey map for [Company] showing how they deliver value:
[your domain]/icp/[company-slug]

Two quick questions:
1. Is this accurate to how [Company] actually works?
2. If yes, do you think [Founder Name] would find it useful?

Trying to gauge if this content is actually valuable or just noise.

No obligation to share - just looking for honest feedback.

Thanks,
Brandon
```

**Why This Works:**
- **Validates the work first:** "Is this accurate..."
- **No explicit intro request:** Lets them decide if it's worth sharing
- **Respects weak relationship:** "No obligation to share"

---

## Step 3: Track & Follow Up (Days 3-7)

### Response Tracking Spreadsheet

```
| Connector   | Date Sent | Response? | Forwarded? | Founder Response? | Next Step                     |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| John Smith  | 11/12     | Yes       | Yes        | Pending           | Follow up in 3 days           |
| Sarah Lee   | 11/12     | Yes       | No         | N/A               | Ask if content wasn't relevant |
| Mike Chen   | 11/13     | No        | N/A        | N/A               | Follow up in 5 days           |
```

### Follow-Up Sequence

**If Connector Doesn't Respond (Day 5):**
```
Quick bump on this - totally fine if you didn't have time to review.

If it's not a priority, no worries. Just didn't want it to get buried.

-B
```

**If Connector Says "Not Comfortable Sharing":**
```
Totally understand - appreciate you taking a look.

Out of curiosity, was it:
a) Content wasn't good enough to share
b) Relationship isn't strong enough
c) Timing is off

Just trying to calibrate for future asks.

Thanks for being honest!
```

**If Connector Forwards But No Founder Response (Day 7):**
```
Hey [Connector],

Did [Founder Name] ever get back to you about that [Company] customer journey map?

No worries if they're swamped - just want to make sure it didn't get lost in their inbox.

If they're not interested, totally cool. Appreciate you forwarding it.

-Brandon
```

---

## Step 4: When Founders Respond (Days 1-14)

### Response Category 1: "This is amazing, how did you build this?"

**Your Reply:**
```
Thanks [Founder Name]! Glad it resonated.

We used Andru (the platform I'm building) to map your customer's emotional journey - basically reverse-engineering where [Company] creates value and what pain points you're solving.

Two quick questions if you have 2 minutes:
1. What did we nail?
2. What did we miss?

I'm refining the methodology and your feedback would be incredibly helpful.

Also - if you ever want to see how we'd map your *actual* ICP (not just customer journey), happy to show you the platform. Takes 3 minutes.

But no pressure - just appreciate you taking the time to read it.

-Brandon
```

**Next Step:** Book a 15-min call to show them Andru

### Response Category 2: "This is interesting, but not quite accurate"

**Your Reply:**
```
Really appreciate the honesty, [Founder Name].

Specifically curious: what parts were off?

Was it:
- Wrong persona (we assumed [persona], should have been [X])?
- Wrong pain point (we focused on [pain], but it's actually [Y])?
- Wrong value delivery (we said [Company] solves [X], but it's really [Y])?

Trying to get better at this, and your corrections would be super valuable.

If you're up for a 15-min call to walk me through the real customer journey, I'd love to learn. And in exchange, I can show you how Andru builds these insights for your own ICP.

Either way, thanks for the feedback!

-Brandon
```

**Next Step:** Use their corrections to refine the page, then re-share and ask for another round of feedback

### Response Category 3: "This is great, can we use it internally?"

**Your Reply (JACKPOT):**
```
Absolutely, [Founder Name]!

You're welcome to use it for:
- Sales enablement (train your team on value delivery)
- Product positioning (refine messaging)
- Investor decks (show you understand your customer)

Two small asks:
1. Add a "Credit: Andru" footnote if you share externally
2. Let me know how your team uses it (just curious for my own learning)

Also - if this was valuable for understanding *your* customers, imagine what you could do if you had this level of intelligence for *your* ICP.

That's what Andru does. Happy to show you in 15 minutes if you're curious.

But zero pressure - just glad you found it useful!

-Brandon
```

**Next Step:** This is a warm lead. Follow up in 3 days with demo link.

### Response Category 4: "No response"

**Follow-Up (Day 7):**
```
Hey [Founder Name],

Not sure if you saw [Connector Name]'s message about the [Company] customer journey map we built.

No worries if you're swamped - just didn't want it to get lost in your inbox.

If you do get a chance to skim it (2-min read), I'd love to know:
1. Did we nail it?
2. If not, what did we miss?

Trying to get better at understanding how [Company] delivers value.

Link: [your domain]/icp/[company-slug]

-Brandon
```

---

## Step 5: Convert Responses to Opportunities

### Path A: Discovery Call

**When they ask "How did you build this?"**

**Your Response:**
```
Would love to show you! It's a 15-min walkthrough of how Andru maps ICPs.

Here's a Calendly link if you're curious: [calendly link]

Or if you want to just try it yourself first, here's the free assessment: [assessment link]

Takes 3 minutes and gives you an ICP clarity score + specific recommendations.
```

### Path B: Co-Marketing Opportunity

**When they say "Can we use this internally?"**

**Your Response:**
```
Even better idea: what if we co-brand it?

- Add [Company] logo
- Customize the CTAs to your product demo
- Publish it on your blog as thought leadership

You get free content for your sales team, we get credit/backlink.

Win-win?

If you're interested, happy to hop on a quick call to discuss.
```

### Path C: Direct Sale

**When they're a perfect ICP fit (Series A, technical founder, struggling with sales)**

**Your Response:**
```
By the way [Founder Name], noticed you're at [stage].

If you're anything like the 47 other technical founders we work with, you're probably dealing with:
- Pipeline full of wrong-fit prospects
- Sales team that can't articulate ROI
- Board asking "What's your ICP?"

Sound familiar?

If so, Andru can help. We generate this level of buyer intelligence for *your* company in 3 minutes.

Would love to show you - here's a 15-min demo link: [calendly]

Or try the free assessment first: [assessment link]

## Pro Tips

### 1. Personalize the Connector Request
Don't copy-paste the template. Add a personal line:
- "I know you and [Founder] worked together at [Company]..."
- "Saw you mentioned [Company] in your tweet last week..."
- "Remember when we talked about how hard ICP mapping is? Built something for that..."

### 2. Make It Easy to Forward
Connectors are busy. Make it one-click:
- Write the forwarding message FOR them
- Include it in your request: "Feel free to use this template..."
- Reduces friction from 5 minutes to 30 seconds

**Example:**
```
"If you want to forward it, feel free to copy-paste this:

---
Hey [Founder],

Brandon built something interesting for [Company] - a customer journey map showing how you deliver value.

Thought you'd find it useful for product/sales positioning.

Link: [url]

No obligation to check it out, but seemed relevant.

-[Connector]
---
"
```

### 3. Batch Your Outreach
Don't send 30 requests in one day. Spread it out:
- Day 1: 10 requests
- Day 3: 10 requests
- Day 5: 10 requests

Gives you time to handle responses and refine your approach.

### 4. Celebrate the "No's"
If a connector says "Not comfortable sharing," **that's valuable data**:
- Content isn't good enough → Improve the page
- Relationship isn't strong enough → Move to direct outreach
- Timing is off → Follow up in 3 months

Don't take it personally. Use it to improve.

### 5. Turn Responders into Connectors
When a founder responds positively, ask:
```
"By the way, if you know other founders who need ICP clarity, I've got 93 more of these.

Happy to build one for any company you think would find it valuable."
```

This creates a referral loop.

---

## Common Objections & How to Handle

### Objection 1: "I don't want to bother them"

**Response:**
"You're not bothering them - you're sharing valuable content. If you saw an article that deeply analyzed their business in a useful way, wouldn't you share it? Same thing here."

**Alternative:**
"Let me phrase it differently: if someone built this for YOUR company, would you want to see it? If yes, [Founder] probably does too."

### Objection 2: "What if they don't like it?"

**Response:**
"Then you get valuable feedback on how to improve it! Either way, it's a conversation starter. Worst case, they ignore it. Best case, they love it and want to work with you."

### Objection 3: "What's in it for me?"

**Response:**
"You're adding value to a relationship. You're the person who shares useful, non-salesy content with your network. That's valuable social capital."

**Alternative:**
"If they find it useful and end up using Andru, I'll give you 20% of their first year as a referral fee." (if you want to incentivize)

## Templates for Different Connector Types

### For YC Partners/Alumni
```
Hey [Name],

Know you work with [Company] through YC. Built a customer journey map for them that I think [Founder] would find useful.

It's the kind of ICP intelligence we wish we had during our batch.

Link: [url]

Would you be comfortable sharing? If not, no worries - just trying to gauge if this content is actually valuable.

-Brandon
```

### For Investors
```
Hey [Name],

Saw [Company] is in your portfolio. Built a customer journey map for them showing how they deliver value.

Thought it might be useful for their sales positioning (or at least interesting to you as an investor).

Link: [url]

Feel free to forward if you think [Founder] would appreciate it.

-Brandon
```

### For Former Colleagues
```
Hey [Name],

Remember when we used to debate ICP strategy? Built something that scratches that itch.

It's a customer journey map for [Company] - shows how they deliver value from pain point to "wow" moment.

Link: [url]

If you're still in touch with [Founder] (saw you worked together at [Company]), would love their feedback on whether we nailed it.

Either way, curious what you think!

-Brandon
```

## Next Steps After Successful Referrals

Once you've got 5-10 founder responses, document what's working:

1. **Which pages get the best response?** (Some industries may resonate more than others)
2. **Which connectors are most effective?** (YC alumni? Investors? Former colleagues?)
3. **Which follow-up messages convert best?** (A/B test your templates)
4. **What feedback are you getting?** (Use it to refine future pages)

Then scale up:
- Create 10 more custom pages for high-value prospects
- Expand your connector network
- Turn successful referrals into case studies
