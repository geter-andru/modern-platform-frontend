# OPTION 1: DIRECT OUTREACH PLAYBOOK
## Personalized LinkedIn + Email Sequences Using Custom ICP Pages

**Status:** Secondary strategy - execute after Option 2
**Timeline:** Week 2-4
**Expected Results:** 20-40% response rate (vs 2-5% for standard cold outreach)

---

## The Strategy

Direct outreach to the 94 companies using the custom ICP pages as "value-first" lead magnets. This combines LinkedIn connection requests with email follow-ups for maximum reach.

**Why This Works:**
- You're leading with value (the custom page), not a pitch
- You demonstrate expertise before asking for anything
- The personalization is at a level they've never seen before
- Creates curiosity gap: "How did they understand our business this well?"

---

## Step 1: Identify Target Decision-Makers (Day 1-2)

### Who to Target at Each Company

**Primary Targets (Best Response Rates):**
1. **Founders/Co-Founders** - Highest authority, care most about ICP
2. **VP Product** - Owns product positioning and value delivery
3. **Head of GTM / CRO** - Responsible for sales strategy
4. **VP Engineering** (for technical product companies) - Understands customer pain

**Secondary Targets (Good for Multi-Threading):**
5. **Head of Product Marketing** - Owns messaging and positioning
6. **Director of Sales Enablement** - Trains team on value communication
7. **Head of Customer Success** - Knows real customer pain points

### How to Find Them

**Method 1: LinkedIn Sales Navigator**
```
Search: company:[Company Name] AND title:(founder OR "vp product" OR "head of GTM")
Filter: Current company, 2nd/3rd degree connections
```

**Method 2: Apollo.io**
```
Company: [Company Name]
Title: Founder, VP Product, CRO, VP Engineering
Export: Name, LinkedIn URL, Email
```

**Method 3: Company Website**
```
Check: /about, /team, /company pages
Look for: Leadership team
Verify: LinkedIn profiles
```

**Method 4: Twitter/X**
```
Search: "founder of [Company]" OR "@[company] founder"
Check: Bio for LinkedIn link
```

### Create Your Outreach Spreadsheet

```
| Company    | Name           | Title       | LinkedIn URL            | Email               | Source    | Outreach Date | Response | Notes |
|------------|----------------|-------------|-------------------------|---------------------|-----------|---------------|----------|-------|
| Greptile   | Daksh Gupta    | Co-Founder  | linkedin.com/in/daksh   | daksh@greptile.com  | Apollo    | 11/15         | Pending  | YC W24|
| PostHog    | James Hawkins  | Co-Founder  | linkedin.com/in/james   | james@posthog.com   | Website   | 11/15         | Pending  |       |
```

**Goal:** Identify 1-2 decision-makers per company (188 total contacts across 94 companies)

---

## Step 2: LinkedIn Connection Request Sequence

### The Approach

LinkedIn allows **personalized connection requests up to 300 characters**. This is your first touchpoint. Make it count.

### Template A: For Founders (Curiosity + Value)

**Connection Request (298 characters):**
```
Hi [First Name], built something unusual for [Company] that shows how you deliver value to customers. Full customer journey map from pain point to "wow" moment. No pitch - just thought you'd find it interesting. Would love your feedback: [short URL]/icp/[slug]
```

**Why This Works:**
- **Curiosity gap:** "built something unusual"
- **Specific:** "customer journey map"
- **No ask:** "just thought you'd find it interesting"
- **Link included:** They can review before accepting
- **Request for feedback:** Flattering and engaging

### Template B: For VPs/Heads (Problem + Solution)

**Connection Request (296 characters):**
```
Hi [First Name], I mapped out how [Company]'s customers experience value - from first panic moment to the timestamp where you solve their problem. Built it to understand buyer intelligence. Would love to know if we nailed it: [short URL]/icp/[slug]
```

**Why This Works:**
- **Concrete deliverable:** "mapped out how..."
- **Emotional language:** "first panic moment"
- **Humility:** "would love to know if we nailed it"
- **Shows expertise:** Demonstrates you've studied their business

### Template C: For Technical Roles (Data + Insight)

**Connection Request (287 characters):**
```
Hi [First Name], analyzed [Company]'s value delivery and built a timeline showing where your product creates impact. Used it to study buyer intelligence for technical products. Curious if it matches your customer reality: [short URL]/icp/[slug]
```

**Why This Works:**
- **Analytical framing:** "analyzed", "timeline", "data"
- **Technical language:** Resonates with engineering minds
- **Question format:** "Curious if it matches..."
- **Shows respect:** "your customer reality"

### LinkedIn Sequence (Post-Connection)

**Day 1: They Accept Connection**

**Message 1 (Immediate, if they don't click link):**
```
Thanks for connecting, [First Name]!

Did you get a chance to check out the [Company] customer journey map?

Link again in case it got buried: [full URL]/icp/[company-slug]

Specifically curious about the "[scenario title]" section - did we nail the emotional arc or completely miss it?

No pressure - just refining the methodology and your feedback would be invaluable.

Best,
Brandon
```

**Day 3: Follow-Up (if no response)**

**Message 2:**
```
Quick follow-up, [First Name]:

I know you're slammed, but if you have 90 seconds to skim that [Company] customer journey map, I'd love to know:

1. What did we nail?
2. What did we completely miss?

I'm trying to get better at understanding how technical products deliver value, and [Company] is a masterclass in that.

Link: [url]

Appreciate any feedback - even "this is totally wrong" helps me improve.

-Brandon
```

**Day 7: Value Pivot (if still no response)**

**Message 3:**
```
[First Name],

Different question (unrelated to the customer journey map):

What's the single biggest gap between how you *think* customers experience [Company] vs. how they *actually* do?

Asking because I'm building a platform (Andru) that maps buyer journeys automatically, and I'm trying to understand if there's a real problem here or if I'm just creating consultant theater.

Your take would be super valuable.

-Brandon
```

---

## Step 3: Email Sequence (Parallel Track)

### Email Timing Strategy

Don't send email same day as LinkedIn request. Create space:
- **Day 1:** LinkedIn connection request
- **Day 3:** Send email (if they haven't responded on LinkedIn)
- **Day 5:** LinkedIn follow-up
- **Day 8:** Email follow-up

This creates multiple touchpoints without feeling spammy.

### Email Template A: For Founders

**Subject:** This is how [Company] delivers value (according to Andru)

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

I built something unusual for [Company] that I think you'll find interesting.

I mapped out the emotional journey of one of your customers - from the moment they realize they need [product category] to the specific timestamp where [Company] delivers value.

It's a narrative timeline showing:
- The worst-case scenario your customers are avoiding
- What they're thinking and feeling at each stage
- The exact moments where [Company] creates impact

I'm sharing it because:
1. It's free - no strings attached
2. I think you'll find it valuable for internal positioning/sales enablement
3. If you find it useful, I'd love 15 minutes to understand your ICP strategy

Here's the link: [your domain]/icp/[company-slug]

Curious what you think - especially whether we nailed the "{scenario title}" part or completely missed it.

Best,
Brandon Geter
Founder, Andru

P.S. - This is the kind of buyer intelligence Andru generates for SaaS companies in 3 minutes. If you ever want to see how we'd map YOUR ICP (not just customer journey), happy to show you: [calendly link]
```

**Why This Works:**
- **Subject line:** Specific + intriguing
- **First paragraph:** Sets up the "gift"
- **Bullets:** Easy to scan
- **Three reasons:** Manages expectations (no hidden ask)
- **Specific ask:** "curious what you think" is low-pressure
- **P.S. section:** Subtle pitch without being pushy

### Email Template B: For VPs/Directors

**Subject:** Quick question about [Company]'s ICP

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Random question: when your customers first realize they need [product category], what's the specific trigger?

Is it:
- A failed [process] that cost them $X?
- A compliance deadline they're about to miss?
- A technical limitation that's blocking growth?
- Something else entirely?

Asking because I built a customer journey map for [Company] trying to understand this exact moment:

[your domain]/icp/[company-slug]

The scenario I mapped assumes [assumption from scenario]. But I'm wondering if that's accurate or if I completely missed the real pain point.

Would love your take - even if it's just "yeah that's close" or "nope, totally wrong."

Appreciate any feedback.

Best,
Brandon

Brandon Geter
Founder, Andru
Helping technical founders figure out their ICP in 3 minutes
```

**Why This Works:**
- **Opens with question:** Engages immediately
- **Multiple choice format:** Easy to respond to
- **Shows you've done homework:** References their scenario
- **Admits uncertainty:** "wondering if that's accurate"
- **Low-effort response:** "yeah that's close" is easy

### Email Template C: For Technical Roles

**Subject:** Feedback request: [Company] technical customer analysis

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

I'm building a platform that analyzes how technical products deliver value to engineering teams.

As part of my research, I mapped [Company]'s customer journey - specifically how your product solves [specific technical problem] and where the "a-ha" moments happen.

Link: [your domain]/icp/[company-slug]

Two questions (if you have 2 minutes):

1. Technical accuracy: Did I get the actual problem right? The scenario assumes customers are struggling with [technical problem], but is that the real pain?

2. Value delivery: The map shows [Company] creates value at [specific moment]. Is that when customers actually realize "this is worth it"?

No pressure to respond - just trying to improve my methodology for understanding how technical products resonate with developer teams.

If you do have feedback, I'd be incredibly grateful.

Best,
Brandon

P.S. - If this type of analysis is useful, I can show you how Andru generates this for your own ICP. Takes 3 minutes: [assessment link]
```

**Why This Works:**
- **Technical framing:** "customer journey", "technical problem"
- **Specific questions:** Makes it easy to respond
- **Respects their expertise:** "if I got the actual problem right"
- **Optional P.S.:** Doesn't force the pitch

---

## Step 4: Follow-Up Sequences

### Email Follow-Up #1 (Day 8 - if no response to first email)

**Subject:** Re: This is how [Company] delivers value

**Body:**
```
Quick follow-up - did you get a chance to check out the [Company] customer journey map?

No worries if you're swamped. Just didn't want it to get buried in your inbox.

Link again: [url]

Specifically curious if the "[specific detail from scenario]" part resonates with how your customers actually experience [Company].

If it's close, I'd love to hear where we nailed it.
If it's off, I'd love to learn what we missed.

Either way, appreciate your time.

-Brandon
```

### Email Follow-Up #2 (Day 14 - final email)

**Subject:** One last question about [Company]'s ICP

**Body:**
```
[First Name],

Last message, I promise.

Even if you're not interested in what I built, I have one tactical question:

In your experience, what's the single biggest difference between customers who "get" [Company] immediately vs those who churn during onboarding?

Asking because the scenario I built assumes [assumption], but I'm wondering if that's accurate or if I'm completely missing the real distinction.

No obligation to answer - just trying to learn.

Thanks for your time,
Brandon

P.S. - If you ever need help figuring out your ICP, here's a free 3-minute assessment: [assessment link]. Generates a score + specific recommendations.
```

**Why This Works:**
- **Acknowledges it's the last email:** Respects their time
- **Pivots to pure learning:** No sales pressure
- **Specific tactical question:** Shows genuine curiosity
- **P.S. offer:** Gives them an easy next step if interested

## Step 5: Response Handling Playbook

### Response Type 1: "This is impressive, how did you build this?"

**Your Reply:**
```
Thanks [First Name]! Glad it resonated.

We used Andru (the platform I'm building) to analyze [Company]'s value delivery and customer pain points.

Quick breakdown:
- Input: [Company]'s product description + customer reviews
- AI Analysis: Maps emotional journey from pain to value
- Output: Timeline showing where you create impact

Takes about 3 minutes to generate.

Would you be up for a 15-minute call to see how we'd map your *actual* ICP (not just the customer journey)?

Or if you want to try it yourself first: [assessment link]

Either way, happy to answer any questions about the methodology.

Best,
Brandon
```

### Response Type 2: "This is interesting, but [correction]"

**Your Reply:**
```
This is exactly the kind of feedback I need - thank you!

So if I'm understanding correctly:
- We said [X]
- But it's actually [Y based on their correction]

Is that right?

If you're willing, I'd love to hop on a 15-min call to understand the real customer journey. In exchange, I can show you how Andru would map your ICP with the correct assumptions.

Win-win?

Either way, really appreciate you taking the time to correct me.

Best,
Brandon
```

### Response Type 3: "Can we use this for sales enablement?"

**Your Reply (JACKPOT):**
```
Absolutely, [First Name]!

You're welcome to use it internally for:
- Sales training (show team where value is delivered)
- Product messaging (refine positioning)
- Customer onboarding (set expectations)

Two small asks:
1. If you share it externally, add "Credit: Andru" footnote
2. Let me know how it works out (just curious)

Also - if this was valuable for understanding your *customers*, imagine having this intelligence for your *ICP*.

That's what Andru does. We generate:
- Detailed buyer personas
- Pain point mapping
- Value delivery timelines
- Qualification criteria

All in 3 minutes instead of 3 months of manual research.

Would you want to see a demo? Takes 15 minutes: [calendly]

Or try the free assessment first: [assessment link]

Either way, glad you found the customer journey useful!

Best,
Brandon
```

### Response Type 4: "Not interested / Too busy"

**Your Reply:**
```
No problem, [First Name] - appreciate you letting me know.

One quick question (no follow-up, I promise):

Was it:
a) Content wasn't relevant
b) Timing is bad
c) Just not a priority

Just trying to calibrate for future outreach.

Thanks for your honesty!
Brandon
```

---

## Step 6: Conversion Paths

### Path A: Direct to Demo (Highest Intent)

**When to use:** Founder says "this is impressive" or "can we talk?"

**Your response:**
```
Would love to show you how Andru works.

Two options:

1. **15-minute demo** - I walk you through how we generate this intelligence for your ICP
   [calendly link for 15-min demo]

2. **Try it yourself first** - Take the 3-minute ICP assessment, then we can discuss results
   [assessment link]

Which works better for your schedule?
```

### Path B: Assessment Funnel (Medium Intent)

**When to use:** Founder is intrigued but not ready for demo

**Your response:**
```
If you want to see how Andru works without committing to a demo, try the free ICP assessment:

[assessment link]

Takes 3 minutes, gives you:
- ICP clarity score (0-100)
- Specific recommendations
- Comparison to other Series A companies

Then if you want to discuss results, happy to hop on a call.

No pressure either way.
```

### Path C: Content Drip (Low Intent)

**When to use:** Founder engaged but not ready to buy

**Your response:**
```
Glad you found the [Company] customer journey useful!

If you're interested in more content like this, I write about:
- ICP mapping for technical founders
- Translating features into business value
- Systematic approaches to enterprise sales

Drop your email here and I'll send you the next one: [newsletter signup]

Or just follow along on LinkedIn: [your LinkedIn]

Either way, appreciate the conversation!
```

---

## Step 7: Multi-Threading Strategy

Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Reach out to 2-3 people at each company:

### Example: Greptile Outreach

**Contact 1: Founder (LinkedIn + Email)**
- Day 1: LinkedIn connection request
- Day 3: Email with customer journey link
- Day 7: LinkedIn follow-up

**Contact 2: VP Product (Email only)**
- Day 5: Email with technical angle
- Day 12: Follow-up email

**Contact 3: Head of GTM (LinkedIn only)**
- Day 7: LinkedIn connection with positioning angle
- Day 10: LinkedIn message

**Why This Works:**
- Different people have different priorities
- Increases chance of response
- Creates internal discussion ("Did you see what Brandon sent?")
- Doesn't look desperate (you're reaching multiple roles)

---

## Metrics to Track

### Week 2 Benchmarks (Direct Outreach)

- [ ] 100 LinkedIn connection requests sent
- [ ] 50 emails sent
- [ ] 40% LinkedIn acceptance rate
- [ ] 20% email open rate
- [ ] 10% response rate (LinkedIn + Email combined)
- [ ] 5 discovery calls booked
- [ ] 2 demos completed
- [ ] 1 founding member closed

### What "Good" Looks Like

**LinkedIn Metrics:**
- Connection acceptance rate: 35-50%
- Message response rate: 15-25%
- Demo booking rate: 10-15% of responders

**Email Metrics:**
- Open rate: 40-60% (high because of personalization)
- Response rate: 10-20%
- Demo booking rate: 15-20% of responders

**Overall Conversion:**
- 100 outreach attempts → 15-20 responses → 3-4 demos → 1 customer

---

## Pro Tips

### 1. Use URL Shorteners for LinkedIn

LinkedIn character limits are strict. Use bit.ly or rebrandly:
- `andru.ai/icp/greptile` → `bit.ly/greptile-icp`
- Saves 20+ characters
- Tracks click-through rates

### 2. Send Connection Requests in Waves

Don't send 100 requests in one day. LinkedIn may flag you:
- Monday: 25 requests
- Wednesday: 25 requests
- Friday: 25 requests
- Next Monday: 25 requests

### 3. Personalize the First Line

Even with templates, add one personal touch:
```
"Saw you're a YC alum - congrats on the W24 batch"
"Noticed you just raised Series A - exciting time"
"Your post about [topic] last week resonated with me"
```

### 4. A/B Test Subject Lines

Try 3 different subject lines for first 30 emails:
- Version A: "This is how [Company] delivers value"
- Version B: "Quick question about [Company]'s ICP"
- Version C: "Feedback request: [Company] customer analysis"

Track which gets best open rate, then use that for remaining outreach.

### 5. Use Video for High-Value Targets

For top 10 companies you really want:
- Record a Loom video (90 seconds)
- Walk through their custom page
- Point out specific insights
- Ask for feedback
- Include video link in email/LinkedIn

**Example:**
```
"Instead of just sending a link, I recorded a 90-second walkthrough explaining what I built for [Company]: [loom link]

Would love your take."
```

Response rate will be 2-3x higher.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Sending Generic Messages

**Bad:**
```
"Hi, I noticed we're both in the B2B SaaS space. Would love to connect!"
```

**Good:**
```
"Hi [Name], built a customer journey map for [Company] showing how you deliver value. Would love your feedback: [link]"
```

### Mistake 2: Asking for Too Much Too Soon

**Bad:**
```
"Would you be open to a 30-minute call to discuss your GTM strategy?"
```

**Good:**
```
"If you have 90 seconds to skim this, I'd love to know: did we nail it or completely miss?"
```

### Mistake 3: No Clear Next Step

**Bad:**
```
"Let me know if you're interested in learning more."
```

**Good:**
```
"Two options: 15-min demo [link] or try the free assessment first [link]. Which works better?"
```

### Mistake 4: Giving Up After One Touchpoint

**Bad:**
- Send one LinkedIn message
- No response
- Move on

**Good:**
- LinkedIn connection request (Day 1)
- Email (Day 3)
- LinkedIn follow-up (Day 7)
- Email follow-up (Day 10)
- Final outreach (Day 14)

## Advanced Tactics

### Tactic 1: The "Competitor Comparison" Hook

**For companies with clear competitors:**

**Email Subject:** How [Company] compares to [Competitor]

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Built customer journey maps for both [Company] and [Competitor].

Interesting findings:
- [Company] delivers value at [moment]
- [Competitor] delivers value at [different moment]
- Your customers avoid [worst case], theirs avoid [different worst case]

Full analysis: [link to page]

Thought you'd find it useful for competitive positioning.

Curious if I got it right.

-Brandon
```

### Tactic 2: The "Product Hunt Launch" Angle

**If company recently launched on Product Hunt:**

**LinkedIn Message:**
```
Congrats on the Product Hunt launch, [First Name]!

Saw you hit #2 for the day. Impressive.

Built a customer journey map for [Company] that might help with the influx of new users:
[link]

Shows how to position value delivery for people discovering you for the first time.

Would love your feedback - especially now that you're onboarding a ton of new users.
```

### Tactic 3: The "Hiring Signal" Hook

**If company just posted VP Sales job:**

**Email Subject:** Before you hire that VP Sales...

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Saw you're hiring a VP Sales. Smart move.

Built something they'll want on Day 1: a customer journey map for [Company] showing exactly how you deliver value.

[link]

Most VPs spend their first 90 days figuring this out. This gives them the playbook on Day 1.

Feel free to share it with candidates. Or keep it for internal positioning.

Either way, thought you'd find it useful.

Best,
Brandon
```
