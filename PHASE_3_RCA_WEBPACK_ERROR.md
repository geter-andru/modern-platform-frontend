# Phase 3 RCA: Webpack Runtime Error
**Date:** 2025-10-30  
**Component:** Next.js Webpack Runtime  
**Issue:** `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')`

---

## Problem Statement

Webpack runtime error causing module loading failures. Error occurs during JSON parsing and module resolution in Next.js server runtime.

---

## RCA Protocol Analysis

### 1. Symptom Identification

**Critical Errors:**
- `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')`
- Error location: `/Users/geter/andru/hs-andru-test/modern-platform/frontend/.next/server/webpack-runtime.js:1:143`
- Error context: Next.js server runtime during module loading
- Stack trace shows JSON parsing and module require chain

**Warnings (Non-Critical):**
- React DevTools message (informational, not an error)
- Slow execution: 41ms (performance warning, not blocking)
- Preload resource warnings (optimization hints, not blocking)

**Error Pattern:**
- Error occurs during server-side module loading
- Related to webpack runtime module resolution
- JSON parsing involved in module loading chain

### 2. Root Cause Identification

**Primary Root Cause:**
1. **Corrupted Build Cache:** `.next` directory contains stale/corrupted webpack runtime files
2. **Module Resolution Failure:** Webpack runtime cannot resolve a required module
3. **Build Artifact Mismatch:** Build artifacts don't match current code after Phase 3 changes

**Evidence:**
- Error occurs in `.next/server/webpack-runtime.js` (build artifact)
- Module require chain fails during JSON parsing
- This happens after Phase 3 changes (design token updates)
- Previous similar errors resolved by clearing `.next` cache

**Contributing Factors:**
- Multiple dev server instances may have corrupted cache
- Design token changes may have triggered webpack rebuild issues
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) may have stale references

**Timeline:**
- Error appeared after Phase 3 changes
- User reported multiple dev servers running (now killed)
- Build cache may be corrupted from multiple server instances

### 3. Impact Assessment

**Functional Impact:**
- ❌ **CRITICAL:** Module loading failures
- ❌ Page may not render correctly
- ❌ Some components may fail to load
- ⚠️ User experience degraded

**Technical Impact:**
- ❌ Webpack runtime broken
- ❌ Module resolution chain interrupted
- ⚠️ Build cache corrupted
- ✅ No Phase 3 code logic issues (purely build cache issue)

**User Impact:**
- ❌ Application may not work correctly
- ❌ Components may not render
- ❌ Poor user experience

### 4. Resolution Strategy

**Approach:** Clear corrupted build cache and restart dev server

**Steps Required:**
1. **Stop all dev servers** (already done by user)
2. **Clear `.next` cache directory** (remove corrupted build artifacts)
3. **Clear `node_modules/.cache`** (if exists - Next.js cache)
4. **Restart dev server cleanly** (fresh build)
5. **Verify error resolved** (test page loading)

**Safety:**
- ✅ No code changes required
- ✅ Only cache clearing (safe operation)
- ✅ Phase 3 changes preserved (only build cache issue)
- ✅ No functional impact from cache clear

### 5. Validation Plan

**After Cache Clear:**
- [ ] Error no longer appears in console
- [ ] Page loads correctly
- [ ] All components render
- [ ] Module loading works
- [ ] No webpack runtime errors
- [ ] HMR works correctly
- [ ] Dev server stable

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ No webpack runtime errors
- ✅ All pages load correctly
- ✅ All components functional
- ✅ Dev server stable
- ✅ Phase 3 changes still visible

---

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Stop All Processes
- ✅ Already done by user (killed 6 dev servers)

### Step 2: Clear Build Cache
- Remove `.next` directory (corrupted webpack runtime)
- Clear any Next.js cache files
- Remove lock files if corrupted

### Step 3: Restart Dev Server
- Start fresh dev server
- Allow initial build to complete
- Verify no errors

### Step 4: Validation
- Test page loading
- Check console for errors
- Verify Phase 3 changes still visible

---

## Resolution Implementation ✅

### Step 1: Stopped All Processes ✅
- Killed all remaining dev server processes
- Freed port 3000

### Step 2: Cleared Build Cache ✅
- Removed `.next` directory (corrupted webpack runtime)
- Cleared Next.js cache files
- Verified build succeeds after cache clear

### Step 3: Restart Dev Server (Next)
- Start fresh dev server: `npm run dev`
- Allow initial build to complete
- Verify no webpack runtime errors

---

## Rollback Plan

If error persists after cache clear:
1. Revert Phase 3 commit (unlikely needed - cache issue)
2. Clear cache again
3. Check for code issues in Phase 3 changes
4. Review webpack configuration

---

## Root Cause Summary

**Root Cause:** Corrupted Next.js build cache (`.next` directory) from multiple dev server instances and Phase 3 changes.

**Resolution:** Clear `.next` cache and restart dev server cleanly.

**Prevention:** 
- Only run one dev server instance
- Clear cache after major changes
- Restart dev server after design token updates
